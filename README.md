Hangman
Description
This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the hangman drawing is completed.
